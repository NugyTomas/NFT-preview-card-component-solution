## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS



### What I learned

This challenge was very similar to QR code challenge so it wasn't that hard... BUT! I had no idea how to do the hover on the image so I had to change my solution a little bit and I was thinking how to change the thicknes of white border around avatar icon but then I realized its pretty easy.

### Continued development

I will try other challenges and see how will that go. I'm stil a beginner and I have to google alot.
